<p style="text-decoration: underline; display: inline; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Macronutrient</p>
<p style="display: inline; font-size: 18px">- a substance required in relatively large amounts by living organisms, in
    particular.</p>

<li style="margin: 10px"><b>Carbohydrates:</b> These should make up 45 to 65 percent of your daily <a href="#calorieModal">
    calories</a> and are made up of starch, sugar, and fiber.</li>
<li style="margin: 10px"><b>Proteins:</b> These should make up 10 to 35 percent of your daily <a href="#calorieModal">calories
    </a>. Their role in the body includes building, maintaining, and repairing body tissue.  There are other roles too,
    including hormone production and in aiding our immune system.</li>
<li style="margin: 10px"><b>Fats:</b> These should make up about 20 percent of your daily <a href="#calorieModal">calories</a>.
    Despite the misconceptions about fats, they play important roles in our body. Some of these are insulation to keep
    us warm and protect our organs, promoting growth and development, and helping to digest certain vitamins.
</li>

<p>*As you may know, alcohol also provides us with calories, but is not considered a macronutrient since we do not
   need it for survival.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline; display: inline; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Micronutrient</p>
<p style="display: inline; font-size: 18px">- a chemical element or substance required in trace amounts for the normal
    growth and development of living organisms.</p>

<li style="margin: 10px"><b>Vitamins:</b> These can be split into two categories, fat-soluble vitamins (A and D for example)
    and water-soluble vitamins (Bs and C for example). Water-soluble vitamins require a steady daily intake from a
    combinations of food and  <a href="#supplementModal">supplements</a> as your body does not store most of them while
    fat-soluble vitamins are stored in your body tissue.
    <li style="margin: 30px"><b>Vitamin A:</b> Keeps tissue and skin healthy. Plays an important role in bone growth. Also aids
        with vision in dim light. The most common type of Vitamin A is beta-carotene, which is responsible for the orange
        pigment in many foods such as carrots, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and cantaloupe.

        helps the body absorb iron. Some foods rich in vitamin C are kiwis, strawberries, oranges, and bell peppers.
    </li>
    <li style="margin: 30px"><b>Vitamin D:</b> Plays a role in your nerve, muscle, and immune systems. It also helps your body
        absorb calcium. Your body can actually form vitamin D naturally when you are out in the sunlight. Some foods that
        can also provide you with vitamin D are tuna, eggs (yolk), and cod liver oil.

    <li style="margin: 30px"><b>Vitamin E:</b> Vital to your immune system and cell protection. It's <a href="#antioxidantModal">

<li style="margin: 10px"><b>Minerals:</b> These can also be split into two categories, major minerals (calcium, sodium, etc.)
    and trace minerals (zinc, iodine). Trace minerals are needed in much lesser quantities than the major minerals. One
    of the examples mentioned, iodine, can usually be found in the salt you use daily.

        <h3>Antioxidant</h3>
        <p>Antioxidants protect the body from damage caused by harmful molecules called free radicals. You are exposed
            to free radicals by normal processes that take place in your body, the breaking down of certain medicines, and
            pollution.

        <h3>Supplement</h3>
        <p>Something that completes or enhances something else when added to it. For example, using a multivitamin may
            supplement your vitamin C for the day if you are only getting 50% of the recommended amount through your
            diet.
