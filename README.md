My personal website. Also contains the files for my nutrition app project and [my other website](http://arenatopdeck.com).

[Arenatopdeck.com](http://arenatopdeck.com) is a project I am working on for a popular digital card game called 
Hearthstone. Ultimately I want it to be a resource for the game mode "Arena". It is currently hosted on AWS where I 
created a Unix web server and a database using their EC2 and RDS services.
