        <p>If you are here from my personal website, then this is a project I'm working on for a popular digital card
            game called Hearthstone. Until I get all the card pages created, it will be pretty basic.  After that is done I will add the ability
            to filter and search with a Java backend. In Hearthstone there is a game mode called Arena where you make a deck choosing 1 of 3 random
            cards until you have 30. The options available have changed dramatically lately so...</p>

        <p>I created this web site as a reference for what cards are in Arena right now.  If you are like me,
            then you will be playing around Wild cards for months even though they are gone.  Keep in mind this is not
            intended to be a list of cards to play around, that part is up to you.</p>
